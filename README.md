# Kia ora I'm Rohan 👋

I'm a Junior Developer based in Tāmaki Makaurau, Auckland.

After discovering a passion for software, I’ve spent the past 2+ years immersing myself in self-directed learning and hands-on projects. I began exploring web development through a Udemy course by London’s App Brewery, and quickly became hooked. I then completed HarvardX's CS50x, learning about computer science fundamentals like binary, memory management, data structures, algorithms, and programming in C. From there, I progressed to building projects with frameworks like React, Angular, Next.js, and .NET, and expanded my knowledge to cloud infrastructure with AWS's Certified Cloud Practitioner certification.

I’m currently studying at [Dev Academy Aotearoa](https://devacademy.co.nz/), with my cohort finishing in December this year. I'm on the hunt for an entry-level developer role, so if you're looking for someone who’s driven, collaborative and eager to learn, flick me a message. I’d love to chat.
