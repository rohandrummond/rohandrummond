# kia ora I'm rohan ðŸ‘‹

After years of coding as a hobby, I've taken the leap from a career in marketing to pursue my passion full time. Since 2023, Iâ€™ve been self-employed and developing my skillset, while volunteering for a charity in the environmental space. 

Iâ€™m currently on the hunt for my first dev gig. If youâ€™re looking for someone whoâ€™s a team player and eager to learn, Iâ€™d love to chat!
