### Kia ora I'm Rohan 👋

I'm a software developer based in Tāmaki Makaurau, Auckland. 

After spending almost 5 years in the marketing industry across various roles in research, insights and advertising, I decided to transition into tech. I spent 2+ years teaching myself to code, and just completed [Dev Academy Aotearoa](https://devacademy.co.nz/)'s full time software development programme, with 800 hours of hands-on learning.
