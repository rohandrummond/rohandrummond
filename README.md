# kia ora I'm rohan ðŸ‘‹

After years of coding as a hobby, Iâ€™ve taken the leap from a career in marketing to pursue my passion full time. 

Like many, I began dipping my toes into web dev through a Udemy course by London App Brewery's Angela Yu. I was hooked and decided to continue on to HarvardX's CS50x, getting into computer science fundamentals like binary, memory management, data structures, algorithms, and programming in C. Since then I've been volunteering, learning and building projects with modern technologies like React, Node.js, MongoDB, and AWS.

Now Iâ€™m on the hunt for my first dev gig. If youâ€™re looking for someone whoâ€™s collaborative and eager to learn, flick me a message. Iâ€™d love to chat!
